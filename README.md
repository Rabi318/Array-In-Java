# Array-In-Java
Array in java is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.
The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location.
It is a data structure where we store similar elements.

Features of an array:-
-A java array variable can be declared like other variables with [] after the data types.
-The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index beginning from zero.
-In java array are objects and thus they occupy memory in 'Heap area'.
-The direct superclass of an array type is object.
-They are always created at runtime.
-The length of an array can be find by using member 'length', This is different from C/C++ where we find length using sizeof.
-The elements of an array are stored in consecutive memory locations.
